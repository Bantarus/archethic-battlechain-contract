# Welcome to the First Ever Battlechain on Archethic

The Battlechain acts as an autonomous and decentralized game server.

The main feature is a turn-based battle game where you charge into battle with your archmon 🐱.

You start the game with an archmon 🐱 level 1 with 10 actions.

The game lifecycle is managed by 3 temporal variables:

- **Day**: Counts each day that has passed since the deployment of the Battlechain.
- **Round**: 2 rounds per day, one at noon and the second at midnight.
- **Turn**: 1 turn every 30 minutes.

You can play 1 action per turn ( 🥐 Feed, 💗 Heal, or ⚔️ Attack ).
You can 💤 refresh your actions pool once a day.
You can ⚕️ resurrect your archmon one time each round.

Begin to interact with your archmon 🐱 by pressing ▶️ Play.
(The Battlechain may take a few minutes to add the player the first time on testnet.)

## Available Actions

- **⚔️ Attack**: Your archmon 🐱 deals damage to his target equal to his power.
- **🥐 Feed**: Your archmon 🐱 gains 20xp.
- **💗 Heal**: Your archmon 🐱 gains health equal to his power.
- **💤 Sleep**: Restore your actions pool.
- **⚕️ Resurrect**: Bring your archmon 🐱 back to life.

(More features coming soon...)

Enough talk, let's ▶️ Play!
